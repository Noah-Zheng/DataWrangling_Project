    "When solving the tidiness issue concerning the prejection table, I started with the method in the [link](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/17676), but faild with ValueError (setting an array element with a sequence). Cannot solve the problem. Tried to  melt the three groups one by one. One issue came up when merge these three melted table is the result table is much larger than the intented size which should be 6225. After look into the individual melted table, there are duplicates which will result in an increase in the rows when merge with another table with duplicates. Cannot solve this problem either. Find another method on [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38862832/pandas-melt-several-groups-of-columns-into-multiple-target-columns-by-name ) which is `pd.wide_to_long`. At first, cannot figure out how stubnames and sep works. After changing the name as the example in the stakoverflow post, it worked. I realised that the stubnames should be related to the column names in the table. The result table is the result I wanted. However, one column indicating which prediction it is should be added in the table.  "
